## Design

### Colours

I chose bright colors for the footer and navbar to make the application more positive.
I added a picture with a starry sky to make the application relaxing.

### Structure

#### Website pages

The site was designed for the user to be familiar with the layout, such as a navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screens.

The footer contains all relevant social media links that the business has, so the user can visit any social media site and follow the business there to expand the business's followers, likes, and shares.

The site consists of the following pages:

- Login page where the user can log in to his account.
- Register page where the user can register.
- Homepage where the user can see all his tasks.
- Create/Update task page, where the user can create or update the task.
- Delete page, where the user can delete the task.
- Manual page, where the user can read how to use the application.
- Contact/Feedback page, where the user can complete a form to share his feedback or just send an email to the admin/owner.
- Books page, where the user can see the admin's favorite books on sales development.
- 404 error page to display if a 404 error is raised.

#### Database

- Built with Python and the Django framework with a database of ElephantSQL for the deployed Heroku version (production).

### Heroku Deployment

[Official Page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) (Ctrl + click)

### Heroku Deployment

Before deploying to Heroku, environment variables must be defined in the django project so that local development functions correctly. Once these environment variables are set up in the workspace, the project can be deployed and the environment variables can be copied into heroku as config vars (to ensure the deployed app works correctly with 3rd party dependecies.)

1. Create a file called env.py in the root directory of your workspace and ensure that the file is included in .gitignore. These variables should NOT be committed and pushed to GitHub.
2. import os to the file.
3. os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = URL copied from ElephantSQL
4. os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = A randomly generated key of your choosing. This keeps django from serving data to/from an unauthorised source.
5. os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = The URL from a cloudinary account. This can be found on the following page on the cloudinary website: www.cloudinary.com
<details><summary>Cloudinary</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/cloudinari-key.png">
</details>
These environment variables can now be accessed and configured in the settings.py file of the django project.

The website was deployed to Heroku using the following process:

1. Login to  [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) 

<details><summary>Heroku Login</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/login-heroku.png">
</details>

2. Click on New > Create new app in the top right of the screen.
<details><summary>Create New App</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/create-new-app.png">
</details>

3. Add an app name and select location, then click 'create app'.

<details><summary>Create New App</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/select-app-region.png">
</details>

4. Under the deploy tab of the next page, select connect to GitHub.
5. Log in to your GitHub account when prompted.
<details><summary>Github Deploy</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/deploy-app.png">
</details>

6. Select the repository that you want to be connected to the Heroku app.
<details><summary>Select Repository</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/connect-to-github-project.png">
</details>
7. Click on the settings and in "Config Vars" click on "Reveal Config Vars".
<details><summary>Select Repository</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/reveal-vars.png">
</details>
8. Scroll down to the config vars section, and add config vars specified at the start of this section of the README. Also, include a var with the key 'PORT' and value '8000' to avoid build errors. The end result should look something like this:
KEY: DATABASE_URL
VALUE: postgresurlexample123.com
<details><summary>Configure Vars</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/var-configuration.png">
</details>
9. Navigate back to the 'deploy' tab.
10.  Select automatic deploys to allow Heroku to build the site with new changes each time changes are pushed to GitHub.
<details><summary>Automatic Deploy</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/automatic-deploy.png">
</details>
11.  In the 'manual deploy' section beneath this, make sure the branch selected is 'main' and click deploy branch.
<details><summary>Automatic Deploy</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/manual-deploy.png">
</details>
12.  The site should now be built and Heroku should provide a url for the built site.
