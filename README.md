## Design

### Colours

I chose bright colors for the footer and navbar to make the application more positive.
I added a picture with a starry sky to make the application relaxing.

### Structure

#### Website pages

The site was designed for the user to be familiar with the layout, such as a navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screens.

The footer contains all relevant social media links that the business has, so the user can visit any social media site and follow the business there to expand the business's followers, likes, and shares.

The site consists of the following pages:

- Login page where the user can log in to his account.
- Register page where the user can register.
- Homepage where the user can see all his tasks.
- Create/Update task page, where the user can create or update the task.
- Delete page, where the user can delete the task.
- Manual page, where the user can read how to use the application.
- Contact/Feedback page, where the user can complete a form to share his feedback or just send an email to the admin/owner.
- Books page, where the user can see the admin's favorite books on sales development.
- 404 error page to display if a 404 error is raised.

#### Database

- Built with Python and the Django framework with a database of ElephantSQL for the deployed Heroku version (production).

WAVE was used to test the website accessibility.

We have two false positive errors. The WAVE

 the labels have icons instead of text

is a false positive.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| css not loading| The static files configuration in settings.py was not correct. After fixing it, the issue was resolved |
| User could see the tasks of other users| Defensive programming: Configured users to see only their tasks by adding 'mydata = Task.objects.filter(user=request.user)' to the equation.|
|  Users could update and delete other users' tasks |  Adjusted code to check if the task belongs to the user; if not, it shows a 404 page. |
| The footer was not at the bottom of the page when the content was big | "I changed the footer class to 'class="text-center text-white fixed-bottom"'. After that, the issue was fixed on all pages. |
| The contact form was not saving subject of a message in admin. | Modified views.py script for feedback page to link correct subject to correct variable. |
| The homepage was not displaying correctly when the user had no tasks. | I found that it was counting tasks for other users. I added an additional filter to make the application count tasks only for the logged-in user by including 'user=request.user'.|
| Update page did not open, when I pressed on update button | The links were not set within urls.py, so they just needed to be wired up to load each relevant page." |
| Admin panel has "section" which is not used | Opened ticket with support, they informed me to leave everything as it is https://res.cloudinary.com/dtdqranu0/image/upload/v1699719979/pictures/glxfztk7cqr8r4n9puc9.png |
| In login, while testing  register/login page on different resolutions,  form form-control shrinks differently than input field. For this reason. For this reason"form-control" and input field have different sizes" https://res.cloudinary.com/dtdqranu0/image/upload/v1699790878/pictures/xcvu2nx2dfcq6gvxndrd.png | Created chat with support. Support informed me to leave everything as it is and just to add comment to bugs that bootstrap code does not work as expected https://res.cloudinary.com/dtdqranu0/image/upload/v1699790885/pictures/xd6fcamkuxomaizc2cee.png |



### Heroku Deployment

[Official Page](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) (Ctrl + click)

### Heroku Deployment

Before deploying to Heroku, environment variables must be defined in the Django project so that local development functions correctly. Once these environment variables are set up in the workspace, the project can be deployed, and the environment variables can be copied into Heroku as config vars (to ensure the deployed app works correctly with 3rd party dependencies).

1. Create a file called env.py in the root directory of your workspace and ensure that the file is included in .gitignore. These variables should NOT be committed or pushed to GitHub.
2. import os to the file.
3. os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = URL copied from ElephantSQL
4. os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = A randomly generated key of your choosing. This keeps django from serving data to/from an unauthorised source.
5. os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = The URL from a cloudinary account. This can be found on the following page on the cloudinary website: www.cloudinary.com
<details><summary>Cloudinary</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/cloudinari-key.png">
</details>
These environment variables can now be accessed and configured in the settings.py file of the django project.

The website was deployed to Heroku using the following process:

1. Login to  [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) 

<details><summary>Heroku Login</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/login-heroku.png">
</details>

2. Select "New" and then choose "Create new app" from the options in the top right corner of the screen.
<details><summary>Create New App</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/create-new-app.png">
</details>

3. Specify an app name, choose a location, and then click on 'create app'.

KEY: DATABASE_URL
VALUE: postgresurlexample123.com
<details><summary>Configure Vars</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/var-configuration.png">
</details>

9. Return to the 'deploy' tab.

10.  Choose automatic deploys to enable Heroku to build the site with new changes whenever updates are pushed to GitHub.
<details><summary>Automatic Deploy</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/automatic-deploy.png">
</details>

11.  In the 'manual deploy' section below, ensure that the selected branch is 'main,' and then click 'deploy branch.
<details><summary>Automatic Deploy</summary>
<img src="docs/heroku-deployment/manual-deploy.png">
</details>
12.  The site should be successfully built, and Heroku will furnish a URL for the constructed site
