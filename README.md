## Design

### Colours

I chose bright colours for footer and navbar to make application more positive.
I added a pcture with star sky to make application relaxing.

### Structure

#### Website pages

The site was designed for the user to be familiar with the layout such as a navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screen.

The footer contains all relevant social media links that the business has so the user can visit any social media site and follow the business there to expand the businesses followers, likes and shares.

- The site consists of the following pages:
  - Homepage with cards for the user to choose to book a table, view the food or drinks menu.
  - Food menu has the current list of all available foods from the database sorted by starters, mains and desserts
  - Drinks menu has the current list of all available drinks from the databse sorted by type
  - Blog page has a paginated list of blogs posted by an admin or authorised user, 4 per page
  - Blog expanded displays a blog the user has selected so they can read the blog, if they are logged in they can also leave a comment which will then need to be approved before it is displayed
  - Book page allows registered users to book a table , guest count, date requested, time requested and table location
  - My bookings displays all bookings for the user that they have made, bookings in the past are automatically expired
  - Edit booking allows the user to change their date, time, table and guest count
  - Cancel booking allows the user to cancel the booking which will then delete it from the database
  - Contact us allows the user to send us a DM if the are registered, or they can contact us from the displayed email and phone number or visit the address listed.
  - Login / Logout allows users to login to make bookings, view, edit, and delete bookings
  - Register allows the user to regiser so they can use the booking system
  - 404 error page to display if a 404 error is raised

#### Database

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| css not loading| the css folder was created in uppercase as CSS, renamed and fixed |
| While logged in as a user, on edit bookings page, if you changed the url booking number and if the number was a valid booking for another user it would access the booking | Defensive programming to make sure that only bookings made by the user would be visible |
| Double bookings | Adjusted code to check that the date, time and table were unique together and to give an error to indicate to the user that the booking was unavailable for that date, time and table combination |
| Food item description not showing on menu | A "p" element was used to encase the jinja code, once removed the food item description was then visible |
| Foods not listing by type, starters, manins and desserts | I needed to fix the database loop for the food items to specify the food type had to be a starter to display in the starter section of the menu, and the same for mains and desserts |
| Drinks not listing by type, wines, beers and cocktails | I needed to fix the database loop for the drinks item to specify the drink type had to be a wine to display in the wine section of the menu, and the same for beers and cocktails |
| Card links not working on home page for book a table, food menu and drinks menu | The links were not set within urls.py so just needed to be wired up to load each relevant page |
| Booking form accepting phone number that are too short | I used Django PhoneNumberField to ensure only valid phone formats were accepted |
